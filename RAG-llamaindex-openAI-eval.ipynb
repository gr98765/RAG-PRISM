MUL TICS\n","bid in 1963. Folklore has it that IBM was not interested in Project MAC’s ideas for paging and\n","segmentation, so instead General Electric (GE) was chosen to build the hardware for the project,the eventual GE 645. Bell Labs joined the software development in 1965.\n","The Multics project had very ambitious and revolutionary goals, so it is not surprising that the\n","project had its moments of intrigue. The project called for delivery of the project in two and a halfyears, but delivery of the GE 645 hardware was delayed such that Multics was not self-hosting\n","2until\n","1968. ARPA considered terminating the project in 1969, and Bell Labs dropped out of the project in1969 as well. Ultimately, the Multics system itself proved to be bigger, slower, and less reliable thanexpected, but a number of signiﬁcant operating systems and security features were developed thatlive on in modern systems, such as the UNIX system that was developed by some of the associatedBell Labs researchers after they left the Multics project, see Chapter 4.\n","Multics emerged as a commercial product in 1973. Honeywell purchased GE’s hardware\n","business in 1970, and Honeywell sold Multics systems until 1985. As Multics systems were expensive($7 million initially), only about 80 licenses were sold. The primary purchasers were governmentorganizations (e.g., US Air Force), university systems (e.g., the University of Southwest Louisianaand the French university system), and large US corporations (e.g., General Motors and Ford).Multics development was terminated in 1985, but Multics systems remained in use until 2000. Thelast running Multics system was used by the Canadian Department of National Defense.\n","The Multics project was unusual for its breadth of tasks, diversity of partners, and duration\n","under development. While any hardware project requires the development of an ecosystem (e.g.,compilers, system software, etc.) for people to program to the hardware, the Multics project wasboth a substantial hardware project, a revolutionary operating systems project, and a groundbreakingsecurity project. This breadth of tasks would be daunting today. Secondly, the Multics project teamrepresented university and industry researchers in addition to a variety of government and industryengineers. Many members of the project were among our greatest computer minds, so it is not easyto assemble such a group. Thirdly, an astounding thing is that the project persisted for nearly 10years before any commercial product was released. In today’s competitive environment, such a long\n","pre-production phase would be highly unusual. As a result, the Multics project had a unique situationthat enabled them to pursue ambitious, long-term goals, such as building a secure operating system.\n","3.2 THE MUL TICS SYSTEM\n","The Multics system architecture is a layered arc hitecture where executing programs may be permitted\n","to access named system resources that are organized hierarchically. In this section, we ﬁrst examinethe basic principles of the system, then its security features. This information is culled from the manyresearch documents published on the Multics system. The most comprehensive documents writtenabout Multics were Organick’s book [237] and the Final Report of the project [280].\n","2Aself-hosting system can be used to develop new versions of itself.3.2. THE MUL TICS SYSTEM 25\n","3.2.1 MUL TICS FUNDAMENT ALS\n","The fundamental concepts in the Multics system are processes and segments. Processes are the ex-\n","ecutable contexts in Multics—that is, they run program code. All code, data, I/O devices, etc. that\n","may be accessed by a process are stored as segments. Segments are organized into a hierarchy of\n","directories that may contain directories or segments.\n","A process’s protection domain deﬁnes the segments that it can access. A Multics process’s\n","protection domain consists of the segments that could be loaded into its descriptor segment and the\n","operations that the process could then perform on those segments. Each segment is associated withits accessibility—i.e., the subjects whose processes can access the segment and the operations that\n","they are allowed to perform. Multics has three different ways of expressing accessibility that we will\n","describe in Section 3.2.1.\n","Segments are addressable either locally within the process’s context or by name from secondary\n","storage (i.e., analogous to modern ﬁle systems). For segments already in a process’s context, Figure 3.1shows that each process is associated with its own descriptor segment that contains a set of segment\n","descriptor words (SDWs) that refer to all the segments that the process can directly access. That is,\n","these segments are directly addressable by the process in the system’s memory\n","3.\n","When Multics process requests a segment that is not already in its descriptor segment, it\n","must name the segment using what is analogous to a ﬁle path. Like modern ﬁle systems, Multicssegments are named hierarchically. For example, the name /U2/War/NewYearsDay is processed\n","starting with the root directory, continuing with subsequent descendant directories (i.e., U2and\n","War), and ﬁnishing with the name of the actual segment (e.g., the NewYearsDay segment). Thus,\n","Multics segment access provided a blueprint for later hierarchical ﬁle systems of UNIX and beyond.If the process’s subject has the permissions to perform the requested operation on the segment, thena new SDW is created with those permissions and is loaded into the process’s descriptor segment.Note that the process must also have the access to all the directories in the segment’s path as well toaccess the segment.\n","3.2.2 MUL TICS SECURITY FUNDAMENT ALS\n","Multics security depends on some fundamental concepts that we introduce before we detail theprotection system and reference monitor. These concepts include the Multics supervisor, protection\n","rings, and Multics segment descriptor words .\n","Figure 3.2 shows the actions that take place when a user logs into a Multics system. First, a\n","user login requires that a component of the trusted computing base (TCB) verify the user’s passwordand build a process for the user to perform their processing. User logins are implemented by aprocess called the answering service . T o authenticate the user, the answering service must retrieve the\n","password segment from the ﬁle system by loading the password SDW into its descriptor segment.\n","The loading and subsequent use of the password segment must be authorized by the core Multics\n","3Of course, a segment may have been swapped out to secondary storage, but from the point of view of the process, the segment is\n","available in memory. It will be swapped in invisibly by the Multics kernel.26 CHAPTER 3.

Each process stores a reference\n","to its descriptor segment in its descriptor base register . The descriptor segment stores segment descriptor words\n","that reference each of the process’s active segments (e.g., segments 0, 1, and N).\n","component, the supervisor [322]. If authorized, a SDW for the password segment is loaded into the\n","answering service’s descriptor segment. The supervisor implements the most trusted functionality\n","in the Multics system, such as authorization, segmentation, ﬁle systems, I/O, scheduling, etc. EarlyMultics systems also included dynamic linking functionality in the supervisor, but that was laterremoved [62] and is also implemented in user-space in modern systems.\n","The supervisor is isolated from other processes by protection rings [281]. Protection rings form\n","a hierarchical layering from the most privileged ring, ring 0 where the most-privilege code in thesupervisor runs, to the least privileged ring. There were 64 rings in the GE 645 Multics system, butonly 8 were implemented in GE 645 hardware and the rest by some software tricks. The supervisor3.2.

The user’s password is submitted to the Multics answering service\n","which must check the password against the entries in the password segment. The Multics supervisor in\n","the privileged protection ring 0 authorizes access to this segment and adds a SDW for it to the answering\n","service’s descriptor segment. The answering service cannot modify its own descriptor segment.\n","is protected from other processes because only its segments are assigned to rings 0 and 14, and\n","no process running in a higher ring can modify its segments. Thus, processes can only cause a\n","modiﬁcation of the supervisor’s state by invoking supervisor code that runs in ring 0. Multics deﬁnesmechanisms to protect the supervisor from malicious input in these calls. The Multics design aimedfor layering of function as advocated by other systems of the time, such as the THE system [ 76],\n","but the rings were ultimately used as a simple, coarse-grained mechanism to protect the integrity ofthe supervisor and other trusted processes from untrusted code. Of course, modern processors alsoprotect their operating systems using protection rings, although only two levels, supervisor and user,are typically utilized.\n","4The Multics supervisor is divided into ring 0 components, including access control, I/O, and memory management, and ring 1\n","components that are less primitive, such as accounting, stream management, and ﬁle system search.28 CHAPTER 3. MUL TICS\n","If the user and password match, then the answering service creates a user process with the\n","appropriate code and data segments for running on behalf of that user. Each live process segment\n","is accessed via a segment descriptor word (SDW) as mentioned above. Figure 3.3 shows the SDW\n","layout [281]. The SDW contains the address of the segment in memory, its length, its ring brackets,\n","Segment Descriptor Word\n","Address Length R1 R2 R3 R W E Gate\n","Access Indicator\n","Figure 3.3: Structure of the Multics segment descriptor word (SDW): in addition to the segment’s address\n","and length, the SDW contains access indicators including ring brackets (i.e., R1, R2, R3), the process’s\n","ACL for the segment (i.e., the rwe bits), and the number of gates for the segment.\n","its process’s permissions (rwe) for this segment, and, for code segments, the number of gates deﬁnedfor the segment. When the process references an SDW, its ring bracket limits access based on thecurrent ring in which the process is running. The process permissions (rwe) limit the operations thatthe process can ever perform on this segment. We examine the meaning of the SDW access ﬁeldsbelow.\n","3.2.3 MUL TICS PROTECTION SYSTEM MODELS\n","The Multics protection system consists of three different, interacting models that individually provide\n","distinct aspects of the overall Multics protection system. For simplicity, We introduce the models inisolation ﬁrst, and the describe the overall authorization process.\n","Access Control List First, each object (i.e., segment or directory) is associated with its own access\n","control list (ACL). Each ACL entry speciﬁes a user identity of processes and the operations that\n","processes with that identity can perform on this object. Note that a user may be speciﬁed using wild-\n","cards to represent groups of users. Segments and directories have different operation sets. Segmentsmay be read (r), written (w), or executed (e), and directories may be accessed to obtain the status ofthe entry (s), modify an entry (i.e., delete or modify ACLs, (m), or append an entry to the directory(a). Note that the ACLs for a segment are stored in its parent directory, so access is checked at the3.2. THE MUL TICS SYSTEM 29\n","parent. Also, any modiﬁcation of an ACL for a segment requires the modiﬁcation permission on\n","the parent directory.\n","Example 3.1. Examples of ACLs on a segment include:\n","rew Jaeger.SysAdmin.*r Backup.SysDaemon.*rw *.SysAdmin.*\n","Also, examples of directory ACLs include:\n","sma Jaeger.SysAdmin.*s Backup.SysDaemon.*sm *.SysAdmin.*\n","When a process requests access to a segment, the ACL of the segment is checked to determine\n","if the user associated with the process has an entry in the ACL that permits the requested operations.If so, the reference monitor authorizes the construction of an SDW with those operations.\n","Rings and Brackets Multics also limits access based on the protection ring of the process. Each\n","segment is associated with a ring bracket speciﬁcation that deﬁnes read, write, and execute permissions\n","of processes over that segment. Also, protection domain transition rules are deﬁned by these brackets.\n","First, a segment’s access bracket deﬁnes the ranges of rings that can read and write to a segment. An\n","access bracket is speciﬁed by a range of rings (r1,r2)where r1≤r2(i.e., r1is more privileged than\n","r2). Suppose a process is running in ring r, then the access rights of that process to a segment with\n","an access bracket of (r1,r2)are determined by:\n","•I f r<r 1, then the process can read and write to the segment.\n","•I f r1≤r≤r2, then the process can read the segment only.\n","•I f r2<r , then the process has no access to the segment.\n","Such a policy ensures that lower rings (i.e., more privileged) have strictly greater access to\n","segments than the higher rings.\n","Multics also uses rings to control the invocation of code segments. A second access speciﬁ-\n","cation, the call bracket , is used along with the access bracket to determine how a process in ring r\n","invokes a code segment. The call bracket is (r2,r3), where r2is same r2as in the access bracket\n","and r2≤r3. If a process at ring rtries to invoke a code segment with an access bracket of (r1,r2)\n","and a call bracket of (r2,r3),the following cases are possible:\n","•I f r<r 1, then the process can execute the code segment, but there is a ring transition from r\n","to a lower privileged ring r1≤r\n","/prime≤r2speciﬁed by the segment (typically, r1== r2, so the\n","transition is obvious).30 CHAPTER 3.

An MLS policy prevents a subject from reading data that is more secret than\n","the subject or writing data to less secret objects. A detailed description of MLS and its semantics is\n","provided in Chapter 5.\n","In Multics, each directory stores a mapping from each segment to a secrecy level. Also, Multics\n","stores an association between each process and its secrecy level. A request is authorized if one ofthree conditions are met:\n","1.Write: The process requests write access only and the level of the segment/directory is greater\n","than (i.e., dominates) or equal to the level of the process.\n","2.Read: The process requests read access only and the level of the segment/directory is less than(i.e., dominated by) or equal to the level of the process.\n","3.Read/Write: The process requests read and write access and the level of the segment/directoryis the same as the process or the process is designated as trusted.\n","Intuitively, we can see that a process can only read a segment/directory if its level is more\n","secret or the same as the level of the object and write a segment/directory if its level is less secretor the same as that of the object. This prevents information leakage by preventing a process fromreading information that is more secret than its secrecy level and preventing a process from writingits information to objects of a lower secrecy level. In Chapter 5, we formally deﬁnes MLS secrecyenforcement.\n","3.2.4 MUL TICS PROTECTION SYSTEM\n","Multics’s protection system consists of these three policies. When a segment is requested, all threepolicies must authorize the request for it to be allowed. If the requested operation is a read , the ACL\n","5MLS is called the Access Isolation Mechanism (AIM) in Multics documentatio n. We will use the current term of MLS for such\n","access control systems.3.2. THE MUL TICS SYSTEM 31\n","is checked to determine if the user has access, the MLS policy is checked to verify that the object’s\n","secrecy level is dominated by or equal to the process’s, and the access bracket is checked to determinewhether the process has read access to the object’s segment (r ≤r2). When the requested operation\n","is awrite , the ACL is checked for write access, the MLS policy is checked to verify that the object’s\n","secrecy level dominates or is equal to the process’s, and the access bracket must permit the currentring write access (r<r 1).\n","An execute request is handled similarly, except the call bracket is used instead of the access\n","bracket, and the request may result in a protection domain transition. The process must have executepermission in the segment’s ACL, the MLS policy must permit reading the segment, and the callbracket must permit execution.\n","Execution of a segment may also result in a transition from the process’s current ring rto the\n","ring speciﬁed by the segment (we call this r\n","/prime) based on the call bracket. There are two cases. First,\n","when this process invokes a code segment with a call bracket where r<r 1, then the process must\n","transition to r/prime(i.e., a lower-privileged ring). Second, when this process invokes a code segment with\n","a call bracket where r2≤r≤r3, then the process must use one of the valid segment gates as an\n","entry point and transition to r/prime(i.e., enter a higher-privileged ring if the gates allow).\n","As described in Chapter 2, a secure protection system consists of a protection state, a labeling\n","state, and a transition state that may only be administered by trusted subjects. Multics deﬁnes itsprotection state based on these three models. The ring brackets deﬁne the allowed protection domaintransitions in the system. There are no object transitions speciﬁed in the Multics policy. Labelingis not speciﬁcally deﬁned in the Multics policy. Presumably, new segments are assigned the MLSlabels and ring brackets from their creator, but this is not speciﬁed.\n","Both the ACL and ring bracket policies are discretionary access control policies. That is, the\n","ACLs and ring brackets for a segment may modiﬁed by any process that has the modify privilegeto the segment’s parent directory. Only the MLS policy is nondiscretionary ormandatory. The MLS\n","policy is loaded with the system at boot-time and is otherwise immutable.\n","3.2.5 MUL TICS REFERENCE MONITOR\n","The Multics reference monitor is implemented by the supervisor. Each Multics instruction either\n","accesses a segment via a directory or via a SDW, so authorization is performed on each instruc-tion. Originally, the supervisor performed such authorizations, but eventually hardware extensionsenabled most SDW authorizations to be performed directly by the hardware [ 281], as we now are\n","accustomed. The supervisor then became responsible for setting up the process’s descriptor segmentand preventing the process from modifying it.\n","In addition to protection state queries, the supervisor also performs protection domain transi-\n","tions by changing the process’s ring as described above. Accessing a code segment has three allowedcases, two that result in a ring transition. Invoking code in a ring below (i.e., more privileged than)the access bracket results in a ring transition to a more-privileged ring. Such transitions require entrythrough a special gate segment that veriﬁes: (1) the number of arguments expected; (2) the data type32 CHAPTER 3. MUL TICS\n","on each argument; and (3) access requirements for each argument (e.g., read only or read-write). The\n","gate segment, also called a gatekeeper, aims to protect the invoked code from potentially malicious\n","input from lower-privileged code. The called procedure must also not depend on the caller for stackmemory, and it must return to the calling code in the proper ring number r.\n","The transition to a lower-privileged ring also generates some security issues. In this case, we\n","may leak information as a result of the call to a lower-privileged ring and that the higher privilegedcode must protect itself on a return. In the ﬁrst case, we need to ensure that the called procedure ina high ring (i.e., less-privileged ring) has access to the procedure arguments. Since the granularityof control is a segment, each segment in which an argument is contained must be accessible to thecalled procedure. Multics can enforce protection on segments, such that the called procedure doesnot get unauthorized access, but that may result in program failures. Thus, some form of copyingis necessary. For example, the supervisor copies arguments from its segment to another segmentaccessible to the called procedure. However, the caller must be careful not to copy unauthorizedinformation, such as private keys, that the less-privileged code may be able to use to impersonatethe higher-privileged code.\n","In the second case, Multics enables the caller to provide a gate for the return, called a return\n","gate . This mechanism is similar in concept to a call gate, except multiple calls may result in a stack of\n","return gates. Thus, the SDW is unsuitable for return gates. The supervisor must maintain the stackof return gates for the process.\n","While supervisor functions are implemented in rings 0 and 1, the fundamental reference\n","monitor services are all in ring 0. For example, the ﬁle system search utility has been moved toring 1, such that the determination of a directory or segment from a name is performed there, butauthorization of whether this access is permitted is done in the ring 0 supervisor [ 279]. That is, the\n","code in ring 1 running due to a user’s process, may not have an ACL that permits it access to thesegment. Thus, ring 0 can limit the actions of code in ring 1. Decisions about what code belongs inring 0 and ring 1 was an ongoing process throughout the Multics project. Modern operating systemshave generally not made suc h ﬁne-grained distinctions, potentially to their detriment for security.\n","Nonetheless, programming is much simpler in the modern case.\n","Some services running in less-privileged rings also must be trusted by the supervisor for some\n","functions. For example, the answering service (see Section 3.2.2) performs authentication, so itassigns the user of a process. Clearly, if it is malicious, the process could get unauthorized permissionsby being assigned to the wrong user. Also, the administrator must be entrusted with several operations,supported by code that must then be trusted, such as measuring storage usage, performing backups,and changing permission assignments [264]. A TCB was deﬁned for Multics’ B2 evaluation (seeChapter 12 for a discussion on system security evaluation), but the Multics architecture continuallyevolved, such that its TCB evolved over time. In 1973, Saltzer stated that 15% of Multics programsr a ni nr i n g0[ 264], so these programs plus administrative and authentication programs minimally\n","deﬁned the Multics TCB. The Multics team recognized that this was a large number of trusted3.3. MUL TICS SECURITY 33\n","programs, but the resolution of what should be in or what should be out of the TCB remained an\n","ongoing issue until the end of the project.\n","3.3 MUL TICS SECURITY\n","We evaluate the security of Multics system using the reference monitor principles stated in Chapter 2:\n","complete mediation, tamperprooﬁng, and veriﬁability. Unlike the commercial operating systemsdiscussed in the next chapter, Multics performs well on these metrics. Nonetheless, we will see thatit is difﬁcult to completely achieve these requirements. In the next section, we will discuss how theimplementation may cause breaches in security, even in well designed systems.\n","1.Complete Mediation: How does the reference monitor interface ensure that all security-sensitive operations are mediated correctly?\n","Since Multics requires that each instruction accesses a segment and each segment access\n","is mediated, Multics provides complete mediation at the segment level. Thus, all securityrequirements that can be effectively expressed in segments can be mediated in Multics.\n","MLS labels for segments are stored in their directories rather than directly in the segments,\n","so Multics must ensure that the mapping between segments and their access classes is usedcorrectly. That is, Multics must prevent a TOCTTOU attack [30] where the attacker canswitch the segment assigned a particular name after the access class assigned to the name hasbeen authorized. Traditionally, this is done by restricting a directory to contain only segmentsof a single access class.\n","2.Complete Mediation: Does the reference monitor interface mediate security-sensitive oper-ations on all system resources?\n","Since Multics mediates each segment access at the instruction level, Multics mediates memory\n","access completely. Multics also mediates ring transitions, in both directions. Thus, the refer-ence monitor provides mediation at memory and ring levels. Multics’ ring transitions provideargument validation via gatekeepers, which is not part of the reference monitor in modern sys-\n","tems (although argument validation is performed pr ocedurally in modern operating system).\n","In practice, the Multics master mode permits code to run in a higher ring level without the full\n","ring transition, see Section 3.4 below.\n","Also, TCB servers may have ﬁner-grained access control (i.e., within segments), but this is\n","beyond the ability of Multics. If Multics had a server that is trusted to support clients of multiplesecrecy levels, it must also ensure that there is no way that an unauthorized information leakcan occur (e.g., the confused deputy problem, see Chapter 10). In general, such servers must be\n","trusted with such permissions.\n","3.Complete Mediation: How do we verify that the reference monitor interface provides com-plete mediation?34 CHAPTER 3. MUL TICS\n","T o verify complete mediation, we need to verify that ring transitions and segment accesses are\n","mediated correctly. These operations are well-deﬁned, so it is straightforward to determine\n","that mediation occurs at these operations. However, the complexity of these operations stillmade veriﬁcation difﬁcult. The complexity of addressing resulted in some mediation errors insegment mediation, see Section 3.4.\n","4.Tamperproof: How does the system protect the reference monitor, including its protection\n","system, from modiﬁcation?\n","The Multics reference monitor is implemented by ring 0 procedures. The ring 0 procedures are\n","protected by a combination of the protection ring isolations and system-deﬁned ring bracketpolicy. The ring bracket policy prevents processes outside of ring 0 from reading or writingreference monitor code or state directly.\n","Some ring 0 code must respond to calls from untrusted processes (e.g., system calls). The only\n","way that ring 0 can be accessed by an untrusted process is via a gate. As described above, gatescheck the format of the arguments to higher-privileged, supervisor code to block maliciousinputs. Thus, if the gates are correct, then untrusted processes cannot compromise any ring 0code, thus protecting the supervisor.\n","Multics master mode code was not designed to be accessed without a ring transition to ring 0,\n","but this restriction was later lifted, resulting in vulnerabilities (see Section 3.4 below). Thus,\n","a secure Multics system must not include the unprivileged use of master mode as Karger andSchell identify.\n","5.Tamperproof: Does the protection system protect all the trusted computing base programs?\n","The Multics TCB consists of the supervisor and some system services in rings 1–3. Multics\n","relegates standard user processing to rings 4 and higher, so trusted code would be placed\n","no higher than ring 3. If we assume that all the code segments in rings 0–3 are part of thetrusted computing base, then the TCB is large, but can be protected in the same manner asthe supervisor in ring 0.\n","The integrity of the TCB depends on its system-deﬁned ring bracket policy. However, the ring\n","bracket policy is a discretionary policy. It can be modiﬁed by any subject with modify access toa directory containing a TCB code segment. Should any process in the TCB be compromised,it could undo protections at its ring level, thus potentially compromising the entire ring. Ifmore-privileged rings contain any code that depends on trust in a less-privileged ring thatis compromised, then the compromise ma y spread further. Thus, Multics tamper-protection\n","is “securable” as Saltzer stated, but discretionary access control makes its tamperprotectionbrittle. See Chapter 7 to see why the use of discretionary access control is problematic.\n","6.Veriﬁable: What is basis for the correctness of the system’s trusted computing base?3.3. MUL TICS SECURITY 35\n","The implementation of the Multics TCB is too large to be formally veriﬁed [ 279].The project’s\n","goal was to minimize the Multics implementation as much as possible, such that most, if not\n","all, of the TCB can be veriﬁed using manual auditing. This goal was not achieved by thecompletion of the Multics project, and in fact this limitation motivated the subsequent workin security kernels (see Chapter 6). As we will see in the next section, this resulted in somesecurity problems in Multics.\n","7.Veriﬁable: Does the protection system enforce the system’s security goals?\n","Verifying that the system’s security goals are enforced correctly involves ensuring that the\n","policy: (1) protects the secrecy and integrity of the system and user data by the protection state;\n","(2) assigns subjects and objects to the policy labels correctly by the labeling state; and (3) ensures\n","that all protection domain transitions protect the secrecy and integrity of the system and user\n","data based on the transition state deﬁned by the call bracket rules.\n","First, the protection state ensures MLS secrecy protection is enforced, although the discre-tionary management of the ring bracket policy limits integrity protection to the system TCBat best, and only if no TCB process can be compromised. The MLS secrecy policy is a manda-tory policy of information ﬂow secrecy goals, so the secrecy goals are enforced by the Multicssystem given a trusted TCB.\n","Second, verifying the correct labeling of segments and processes is challenging since much\n","of this labeling is speciﬁed manually. The Multics policy does not explicitly state how newprocesses and segments are labeled, although we would expect that the norm is to inherit thelabels of the creating process.\n","Third, the transition state permits low integrity code in a less-privileged ring to transfer control\n","to high integrity code in a more-privileged ring through either gates or return gates based onthe call bracket rules. As discussed above, the security of these transitions depends on thecorrectness of the gates, but most systems do not even have this level of enforcement.\n","This informal analysis shows that Multics security is largely very good, but risks remain.\n","In this analysis, we describe powerful mediation, expressive tamperprooﬁng, and veriﬁable secrecycontrols and system integrity controls. However, challenges still remain in managing the scope ofthe TCB, verifying the correctness of system integrity policies, ensuring integrity protection forall processes, labeling processes and segments correctly, and verifying the correctness of all gates.Saltzer identiﬁes nine areas of security risk in Multics as well [ 264]. In addition to the issues above,\n","Saltzer mentions the need for secure communication between systems, control of physical accessto machines, the weakness of user-speciﬁed passwords, the complexity of gate protections for thesupervisor, the possibility of leaking secrets via reuse of uncleared memory or storage, excessiveprivileges for administrators, and others. These issues and challenges are not unique to Multics—aswe will see, every secure operating system design will ﬁght with these challenges. For a ﬁrst attempt\n","at building a secure operating system, the Multics project did an admirable job of identifying issues36 CHAPTER 3. MUL TICS\n","and proposing solutions, but many difﬁcult issues must be addressed. As Saltzer states, Multics was\n","“designed to be securable,” not a single secure conﬁguration.\n","Of course, building any operating system also requires that the designers consider usability,\n","performance, and maintainability in their design. T o a large extent, an operating system is supposed\n","to be invisible to applications. While applications have to use the system’s interface to obtain service,the interface should just implement the requests, so programs can run as expected. Of course, theaddition of security enforcement may cause programs to no longer work as expected. Requestsmay be denied for security reasons, and applications may not be prepared to handle such failures.Also, security is supposed to be effectively invisible from a performance perspective. This was asigniﬁcant problem for Multics, especially given the limited computing power of that time. Thesmall number of deployed Multics systems probably also prevented the usability model of Multicsfrom spreading widely enough to become an accepted norm. As the UNIX community grew tonumbers that dwarfed the number of Multics administrators, the computing community came toaccept the open, but insecure, approach. Finally, operating systems are complex software components,so they undergo a fair amount of evolution. This was particularly true in the case of Multics, but anysystem maintenance must still preserve the security guarantees offered by the system. As we will seein the next section, this was not always the case.\n","3.4 MUL TICS VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS\n","In 1974, a couple of Air Force researchers, Paul Karger and Roger Schell, performed a vulnerability\n","analysis on the Multics system [ 159]. Unfortunately, the Multics system was too complex for them\n","to do any kind of analysis that may prove the security enforcement of the system (i.e., mediation,tamperprooﬁng, or veriﬁability), but they examined the system looking for implementation ﬂaws.\n","That is, they were, and still are, ﬁrm believers in the Multics approach to building a secure operat-\n","ing system, but they found a number of vulnerabilities in the Multics implementation that raisedquestions about how to build and maintain secure operating systems.\n","Karger and Schell’s vulnerability analysis investigates whether speciﬁc hardware, software,\n","and “procedural” (i.e., conﬁguration) vulnerabilities are present in the Multics system. They foundvulnerabilities in each area.\n","First, a hardware vulnerability was found that would permit an execute instruction to bypass\n","access checking using the SDW. That is, complete mediation could be circumvented due to thisvulnerability. The details of the vulnerability require a deeper knowledge of Multics addressing thanwe provide, but the basic problem is that the Honeywell 645 hardware\n","6did not check the SDW\n","access if the segment was reached by a speciﬁc format of indirect addressing. Thus, access to thesegment containing the indirection was checked for access, but not the segment containing theactual address to be executed. It was found that this error was introduced in a ﬁeld modiﬁcationmade at MIT and later applied to all processors. While this is was simply an erroneous update, thepressures of balancing performance and security, makes such updates likely. Further, the Multics\n","6This analysis was done after Honeywell had purchased GE’s computer division in 1970.3.5. SUMMARY 37\n","project had no tools to enable the veriﬁcation of security impact of such changes, so errors should\n","not be unexpected.\n","Second, a variety of software vulnerabilities were reported by Karger and Schell. One of the\n","more signiﬁcant vulnerabilities was an error caused by misuse of a supervisor mode of execution, calledmaster mode . Master mode is an execution state that permits any privileged processor instructions\n","to be executed in the current ring. The original Multics design required master mode code to berestricted to ring 0 only [322]. However, this design choice resulted in all faults (i.e., divide-by-zero,page faults, etc.) incurring a ring transition from the user ring to ring 0 where the fault handlerwas located and then back to the user ring. A proposal to reduce the overhead on the system wasto enable execution of some fault handling (e.g., divide-by-zero and access violations) in the userring. These faults are reported to user programs anyway by a signaller module, so the proposal was\n","to run the signaller in user rings. But, the signaller uses some privileged instructions, so it must runin master mode.\n","Permitting the signaller to run in master mode in a user ring was deemed secure because of the\n","restricted manner in which the signaller must be invoked, but this code was not designed to protectitself from malicious calls. The problem is that the signaller’s code expects a register to be loadedwith a reference to a section of the signaller’s code when it is called. Unfortunately, the signaller doesnot check that the register value is legitimate, so when the code became addressable in user rings, itbecame possible for a malicious user program to set the register to an arbitrary location “permittinghim to transfer to an arbitrary location while the CPU was still in master mode [ 159].” Thus, a\n","signiﬁcant vulnerability was created in the Multics system. The problem was that the signaller codehad been written with other design rules in mind. This is why it is important to: (1) have clear designrules and (2) have approaches and (automated) tools to verify that the implementation meets thedesign rules. Unfortunately, most operating systems are implemented without clear design rules forsecurity, and few approaches are available to verify compliance with such rules.\n","Third, Karger and Schell demonstrated that software vulnerabilities, such as the one above,\n","then enable compromise of all Multics security through further “procedural” vulnerabilities. Theydemonstrate how an attacker can: (1) take control of the Multics patch utility enabling modiﬁcationof trusted programs; (2) forge the user identiﬁcation of processes under the control of the attacker; (3)modify the password ﬁle; and (4) hide the existence of the attacker by modifying the audit trail andinstalling backdoors into the system. This work demo nstrates many of the challenges that modern\n","operating system designers face of hidden threats, such as rootkits. Even if the design is secure and\n","comprehensive, implementation mistakes or poor maintenance decisions can introduce signiﬁcantvulnerabilities.\n","3.5 SUMMARY\n","The Multics designers were the ﬁrst to tackle the challenge of building an operating system that\n","enables comprehensive enforcement of practical secrecy and integrity requirements. This challengewas just one of several that the designers were faced with, as Multics was also one of the ﬁrst,38 CHAPTER 3. MUL TICS\n","structured, time-sharing operating systems as well. As the security analysis shows, the Multics\n","design addressed many facets of building a secure operating system, including deﬁning a referencemonitor to enforce a mandatory secrecy policy and developing a protection ring model to protect theintegrity of the trusted code, among several innovations. Multics set the foundations for buildingsecure operating systems, but our security analysis and the vulnerability analysis of Karger and Schellshow that many difﬁcult issues remain to be addressed. Subsequent work, described in Chapter 6,aimed to address many of these problems, particularly reduction in TCB complexity. First, to clarifythe idea of a secure operating system further, we will examine why ordinary operating systems, suchas Windows and UNIX, are fundamentally not secure operating systems in Chapter 4.39\n","CHAPTER 4\n","Security in Ordinary Operating\n","Systems\n","In considering the requirements of a secure operating system, it is worth considering how far ordinary\n","operating systems are from achieving these requirements. In this chapter, we examine the UNIX and\n","Windows operating systems and show why they are fundamentally not secure operating systems. We\n","ﬁrst examine the history these systems, brieﬂy describe their protection systems, then we show, usingthe requirements of a secure operating system deﬁned in Chapter 2, why ordinary operating systemsare inherently insecure. Finally, we examine common vulnerabilities in these systems to show theneed for secure operating systems and the types of threats that they will have to overcome.\n","4.1 SYSTEM HISTORIES\n","4.1.1 UNIX HISTORY\n","UNIX is a multiuser operating system developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at AT&TBell Labs [266]. UNIX started as a small project to build an operating system to play a game on anavailable PDP-7 computer. However, UNIX grew over the next 10 to 15 years into a system withconsiderable mindshare, such that a variety of commercial UNIX efforts were launched. The lack ofcoherence in these efforts may have limited the market penetration of UNIX, but many vendors, evenMicrosoft, had their own versions. UNIX remains a signiﬁcant operating system today, embodiedin many systems, such as Linux, Sun Solaris, IBM AIX, the various BSD systems, etc.\n","Recall from Chapter 3 that Bell Labs was a member of the Multics consortium. However,\n","Bell Labs dropped out of the Multics project in 1969, primarily due to delays in the project. Ken\n","Thompson adapted some of the ideas of Multics when he initiated the construction of a system\n","that was named as a pun on the Multics system, UNICS (UNIplexed Information and ComputingService). Eventually and mysteriously, the system was renamed UNIX, but the project had begun.\n","UNIX gained mindshare for a number of reasons. Ritchie rewrote UNIX in his new program-\n","ming language C which enabled UNIX to be the ﬁrst portable operating system. This enabled thedevelopment of a UNIX community, since lots of people could run UNIX on a variety of differenthardware. Next, an application program interface was designed for UNIX which enabled program-mers to write application easily, without resorting to assembly language, and these applications ranacross the variety of UNIX-supported platforms.

As Saltzer states, Multics was\n","“designed to be securable,” not a single secure conﬁguration.\n","Of course, building any operating system also requires that the designers consider usability,\n","performance, and maintainability in their design. T o a large extent, an operating system is supposed\n","to be invisible to applications. While applications have to use the system’s interface to obtain service,the interface should just implement the requests, so programs can run as expected. Of course, theaddition of security enforcement may cause programs to no longer work as expected. Requestsmay be denied for security reasons, and applications may not be prepared to handle such failures.Also, security is supposed to be effectively invisible from a performance perspective. This was asigniﬁcant problem for Multics, especially given the limited computing power of that time. Thesmall number of deployed Multics systems probably also prevented the usability model of Multicsfrom spreading widely enough to become an accepted norm. As the UNIX community grew tonumbers that dwarfed the number of Multics administrators, the computing community came toaccept the open, but insecure, approach. Finally, operating systems are complex software components,so they undergo a fair amount of evolution. This was particularly true in the case of Multics, but anysystem maintenance must still preserve the security guarantees offered by the system. As we will seein the next section, this was not always the case.\n","3.4 MUL TICS VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS\n","In 1974, a couple of Air Force researchers, Paul Karger and Roger Schell, performed a vulnerability\n","analysis on the Multics system [ 159].

UNIX started as a small project to build an operating system to play a game on anavailable PDP-7 computer.

The lack ofcoherence in these efforts may have limited the market penetration of UNIX, but many vendors, evenMicrosoft, had their own versions. UNIX remains a signiﬁcant operating system today, embodiedin many systems, such as Linux, Sun Solaris, IBM AIX, the various BSD systems, etc.\n","Recall from Chapter 3 that Bell Labs was a member of the Multics consortium.

THE MUL TICS SYSTEM 25\\n3.2.1 MUL TICS FUNDAMENT ALS\\nThe fundamental concepts in the Multics system are processes and segments. Processes are the ex-\\necutable contexts in Multics—that is, they run program code. All code, data, I/O devices, etc. that\\nmay be accessed by a process are stored as segments. Segments are organized into a hierarchy of\\ndirectories that may contain directories or segments.\\nA process’s protection domain deﬁnes the segments that it can access. A Multics process’s\\nprotection domain consists of the segments that could be loaded into its descriptor segment and the\\noperations that the process could then perform on those segments. Each segment is associated withits accessibility—i.e., the subjects whose processes can access the segment and the operations that\\nthey are allowed to perform. Multics has three different ways of expressing accessibility that we will\\ndescribe in Section 3.2.1.\\nSegments are addressable either locally within the process’s context or by name from secondary\\nstorage (i.e., analogous to modern ﬁle systems). For segments already in a process’s context, Figure 3.1shows that each process is associated with its own descriptor segment that contains a set of segment\\ndescriptor words (SDWs) that refer to all the segments that the process can directly access. That is,\\nthese segments are directly addressable by the process in the system’s memory\\n3.\\nWhen Multics process requests a segment that is not already in its descriptor segment, it\\nmust name the segment using what is analogous to a ﬁle path. Like modern ﬁle systems, Multicssegments are named hierarchically. For example, the name /U2/War/NewYearsDay is processed\\nstarting with the root directory, continuing with subsequent descendant directories (i.e., U2and\\nWar), and ﬁnishing with the name of the actual segment (e.g., the NewYearsDay segment).', '0fd2b7c8-f3ef-4e5e-9846-81e43dab5d65': 'For segments already in a process’s context, Figure 3.1shows that each process is associated with its own descriptor segment that contains a set of segment\\ndescriptor words (SDWs) that refer to all the segments that the process can directly access.

Thus,\\nMultics segment access provided a blueprint for later hierarchical ﬁle systems of UNIX and beyond.If the process’s subject has the permissions to perform the requested operation on the segment, thena new SDW is created with those permissions and is loaded into the process’s descriptor segment.Note that the process must also have the access to all the directories in the segment’s path as well toaccess the segment.\\n3.2.2 MUL TICS SECURITY FUNDAMENT ALS\\nMultics security depends on some fundamental concepts that we introduce before we detail theprotection system and reference monitor. These concepts include the Multics supervisor, protection\\nrings, and Multics segment descriptor words .\\nFigure 3.2 shows the actions that take place when a user logs into a Multics system. First, a\\nuser login requires that a component of the trusted computing base (TCB) verify the user’s passwordand build a process for the user to perform their processing. User logins are implemented by aprocess called the answering service . T o authenticate the user, the answering service must retrieve the\\npassword segment from the ﬁle system by loading the password SDW into its descriptor segment.\\nThe loading and subsequent use of the password segment must be authorized by the core Multics\\n3Of course, a segment may have been swapped out to secondary storage, but from the point of view of the process, the segment is\\navailable in memory.

If authorized, a SDW for the password segment is loaded into the\\nanswering service’s descriptor segment.

For simplicity, We introduce the models inisolation ﬁrst, and the describe the overall authorization process.\\nAccess Control List First, each object (i.e., segment or directory) is associated with its own access\\ncontrol list (ACL). Each ACL entry speciﬁes a user identity of processes and the operations that\\nprocesses with that identity can perform on this object. Note that a user may be speciﬁed using wild-\\ncards to represent groups of users. Segments and directories have different operation sets. Segmentsmay be read (r), written (w), or executed (e), and directories may be accessed to obtain the status ofthe entry (s), modify an entry (i.e., delete or modify ACLs, (m), or append an entry to the directory(a). Note that the ACLs for a segment are stored in its parent directory, so access is checked at the3.2. THE MUL TICS SYSTEM 29\\nparent. Also, any modiﬁcation of an ACL for a segment requires the modiﬁcation permission on\\nthe parent directory.\\nExample 3.1. Examples of ACLs on a segment include:\\nrew Jaeger.SysAdmin.*r Backup.SysDaemon.', '75949fe4-389b-47f0-8a43-1a46b50bb0ec': 'Note that a user may be speciﬁed using wild-\\ncards to represent groups of users. Segments and directories have different operation sets.

Each\\nsegment is associated with a ring bracket speciﬁcation that deﬁnes read, write, and execute permissions\\nof processes over that segment. Also, protection domain transition rules are deﬁned by these brackets.\\nFirst, a segment’s access bracket deﬁnes the ranges of rings that can read and write to a segment. An\\naccess bracket is speciﬁed by a range of rings (r1,r2)where r1≤r2(i.e., r1is more privileged than\\nr2). Suppose a process is running in ring r, then the access rights of that process to a segment with\\nan access bracket of (r1,r2)are determined by:\\n•I f r<r 1, then the process can read and write to the segment.\\n•I f r1≤r≤r2, then the process can read the segment only.\\n•I f r2<r , then the process has no access to the segment.', 'a8c3fdc1-3c61-4569-a066-11af3705d048': 'Also, protection domain transition rules are deﬁned by these brackets.\\nFirst, a segment’s access bracket deﬁnes the ranges of rings that can read and write to a segment.

A second access speciﬁ-\\ncation, the call bracket , is used along with the access bracket to determine how a process in ring r\\ninvokes a code segment. The call bracket is (r2,r3), where r2is same r2as in the access bracket\\nand r2≤r3. If a process at ring rtries to invoke a code segment with an access bracket of (r1,r2)\\nand a call bracket of (r2,r3),the following cases are possible:\\n•I f r<r 1, then the process can execute the code segment, but there is a ring transition from r\\nto a lower privileged ring r1≤r\\n/prime≤r2speciﬁed by the segment (typically, r1== r2, so the\\ntransition is obvious).30 CHAPTER 3.

Call bracketsare the only means of describing transition state in the Multics system.\\nMultilevel Security Multics pioneered the enforcement of Multilevel Security [23, 326] (MLS) in\\noperating systems\\n5. An MLS policy prevents a subject from reading data that is more secret than\\nthe subject or writing data to less secret objects. A detailed description of MLS and its semantics is\\nprovided in Chapter 5.\\nIn Multics, each directory stores a mapping from each segment to a secrecy level. Also, Multics\\nstores an association between each process and its secrecy level. A request is authorized if one ofthree conditions are met:\\n1.Write: The process requests write access only and the level of the segment/directory is greater\\nthan (i.e., dominates) or equal to the level of the process.\\n2.Read: The process requests read access only and the level of the segment/directory is less than(i.e., dominated by) or equal to the level of the process.\\n3.Read/Write: The process requests read and write access and the level of the segment/directoryis the same as the process or the process is designated as trusted.\\nIntuitively, we can see that a process can only read a segment/directory if its level is more\\nsecret or the same as the level of the object and write a segment/directory if its level is less secretor the same as that of the object. This prevents information leakage by preventing a process fromreading information that is more secret than its secrecy level and preventing a process from writingits information to objects of a lower secrecy level. In Chapter 5, we formally deﬁnes MLS secrecyenforcement.', '6b201462-2296-448f-aef6-86748d6e375e': '2.Read: The process requests read access only and the level of the segment/directory is less than(i.e., dominated by) or equal to the level of the process.\\n3.Read/Write: The process requests read and write access and the level of the segment/directoryis the same as the process or the process is designated as trusted.\\nIntuitively, we can see that a process can only read a segment/directory if its level is more\\nsecret or the same as the level of the object and write a segment/directory if its level is less secretor the same as that of the object.

When a segment is requested, all threepolicies must authorize the request for it to be allowed. If the requested operation is a read , the ACL\\n5MLS is called the Access Isolation Mechanism (AIM) in Multics documentatio n. We will use the current term of MLS for such\\naccess control systems.3.2. THE MUL TICS SYSTEM 31\\nis checked to determine if the user has access, the MLS policy is checked to verify that the object’s\\nsecrecy level is dominated by or equal to the process’s, and the access bracket is checked to determinewhether the process has read access to the object’s segment (r ≤r2). When the requested operation\\nis awrite , the ACL is checked for write access, the MLS policy is checked to verify that the object’s\\nsecrecy level dominates or is equal to the process’s, and the access bracket must permit the currentring write access (r<r 1).\\nAn execute request is handled similarly, except the call bracket is used instead of the access\\nbracket, and the request may result in a protection domain transition. The process must have executepermission in the segment’s ACL, the MLS policy must permit reading the segment, and the callbracket must permit execution.', '97af3aae-77d5-4dbf-875a-2c91909f164d': 'THE MUL TICS SYSTEM 31\\nis checked to determine if the user has access, the MLS policy is checked to verify that the object’s\\nsecrecy level is dominated by or equal to the process’s, and the access bracket is checked to determinewhether the process has read access to the object’s segment (r ≤r2).

The process must have executepermission in the segment’s ACL, the MLS policy must permit reading the segment, and the callbracket must permit execution.\\nExecution of a segment may also result in a transition from the process’s current ring rto the\\nring speciﬁed by the segment (we call this r\\n/prime) based on the call bracket. There are two cases. First,\\nwhen this process invokes a code segment with a call bracket where r<r 1, then the process must\\ntransition to r/prime(i.e., a lower-privileged ring). Second, when this process invokes a code segment with\\na call bracket where r2≤r≤r3, then the process must use one of the valid segment gates as an\\nentry point and transition to r/prime(i.e., enter a higher-privileged ring if the gates allow).\\nAs described in Chapter 2, a secure protection system consists of a protection state, a labeling\\nstate, and a transition state that may only be administered by trusted subjects. Multics deﬁnes itsprotection state based on these three models. The ring brackets deﬁne the allowed protection domaintransitions in the system.

The MLS\\npolicy is loaded with the system at boot-time and is otherwise immutable.\\n3.2.5 MUL TICS REFERENCE MONITOR\\nThe Multics reference monitor is implemented by the supervisor. Each Multics instruction either\\naccesses a segment via a directory or via a SDW, so authorization is performed on each instruc-tion. Originally, the supervisor performed such authorizations, but eventually hardware extensionsenabled most SDW authorizations to be performed directly by the hardware [ 281], as we now are\\naccustomed. The supervisor then became responsible for setting up the process’s descriptor segmentand preventing the process from modifying it.\\nIn addition to protection state queries, the supervisor also performs protection domain transi-\\ntions by changing the process’s ring as described above. Accessing a code segment has three allowedcases, two that result in a ring transition. Invoking code in a ring below (i.e., more privileged than)the access bracket results in a ring transition to a more-privileged ring. Such transitions require entrythrough a special gate segment that veriﬁes: (1) the number of arguments expected; (2) the data type32 CHAPTER 3. MUL TICS\\non each argument; and (3) access requirements for each argument (e.g., read only or read-write). The\\ngate segment, also called a gatekeeper, aims to protect the invoked code from potentially malicious\\ninput from lower-privileged code.', '49070fd7-0c6c-4f5d-a7e1-4dcdc85266f5': 'The supervisor then became responsible for setting up the process’s descriptor segmentand preventing the process from modifying it.\\nIn addition to protection state queries, the supervisor also performs protection domain transi-\\ntions by changing the process’s ring as described above.

The\\ngate segment, also called a gatekeeper, aims to protect the invoked code from potentially malicious\\ninput from lower-privileged code. The called procedure must also not depend on the caller for stackmemory, and it must return to the calling code in the proper ring number r.\\nThe transition to a lower-privileged ring also generates some security issues. In this case, we\\nmay leak information as a result of the call to a lower-privileged ring and that the higher privilegedcode must protect itself on a return. In the ﬁrst case, we need to ensure that the called procedure ina high ring (i.e., less-privileged ring) has access to the procedure arguments. Since the granularityof control is a segment, each segment in which an argument is contained must be accessible to thecalled procedure. Multics can enforce protection on segments, such that the called procedure doesnot get unauthorized access, but that may result in program failures. Thus, some form of copyingis necessary. For example, the supervisor copies arguments from its segment to another segmentaccessible to the called procedure. However, the caller must be careful not to copy unauthorizedinformation, such as private keys, that the less-privileged code may be able to use to impersonatethe higher-privileged code.\\nIn the second case, Multics enables the caller to provide a gate for the return, called a return\\ngate . This mechanism is similar in concept to a call gate, except multiple calls may result in a stack of\\nreturn gates. Thus, the SDW is unsuitable for return gates. The supervisor must maintain the stackof return gates for the process.', 'fe54a7cb-ab06-4a49-8c83-0aeb060e69cd': 'Since the granularityof control is a segment, each segment in which an argument is contained must be accessible to thecalled procedure.

For example, the ﬁle system search utility has been moved toring 1, such that the determination of a directory or segment from a name is performed there, butauthorization of whether this access is permitted is done in the ring 0 supervisor [ 279]. That is, the\\ncode in ring 1 running due to a user’s process, may not have an ACL that permits it access to thesegment. Thus, ring 0 can limit the actions of code in ring 1. Decisions about what code belongs inring 0 and ring 1 was an ongoing process throughout the Multics project. Modern operating systemshave generally not made suc h ﬁne-grained distinctions, potentially to their detriment for security.\\nNonetheless, programming is much simpler in the modern case.\\nSome services running in less-privileged rings also must be trusted by the supervisor for some\\nfunctions. For example, the answering service (see Section 3.2.2) performs authentication, so itassigns the user of a process. Clearly, if it is malicious, the process could get unauthorized permissionsby being assigned to the wrong user. Also, the administrator must be entrusted with several operations,supported by code that must then be trusted, such as measuring storage usage, performing backups,and changing permission assignments [264].', '238cb1ca-9613-4bb5-9bcf-c1a33a6cdc9a': 'Thus, ring 0 can limit the actions of code in ring 1.

A TCB was deﬁned for Multics’ B2 evaluation (seeChapter 12 for a discussion on system security evaluation), but the Multics architecture continuallyevolved, such that its TCB evolved over time. In 1973, Saltzer stated that 15% of Multics programsr a ni nr i n g0[ 264], so these programs plus administrative and authentication programs minimally\\ndeﬁned the Multics TCB.

Thus, if the gates are correct, then untrusted processes cannot compromise any ring 0code, thus protecting the supervisor.\\nMultics master mode code was not designed to be accessed without a ring transition to ring 0,\\nbut this restriction was later lifted, resulting in vulnerabilities (see Section 3.4 below). Thus,\\na secure Multics system must not include the unprivileged use of master mode as Karger andSchell identify.\\n5.Tamperproof: Does the protection system protect all the trusted computing base programs?\\nThe Multics TCB consists of the supervisor and some system services in rings 1–3. Multics\\nrelegates standard user processing to rings 4 and higher, so trusted code would be placed\\nno higher than ring 3. If we assume that all the code segments in rings 0–3 are part of thetrusted computing base, then the TCB is large, but can be protected in the same manner asthe supervisor in ring 0.\\nThe integrity of the TCB depends on its system-deﬁned ring bracket policy. However, the ring\\nbracket policy is a discretionary policy. It can be modiﬁed by any subject with modify access toa directory containing a TCB code segment. Should any process in the TCB be compromised,it could undo protections at its ring level, thus potentially compromising the entire ring. Ifmore-privileged rings contain any code that depends on trust in a less-privileged ring thatis compromised, then the compromise ma y spread further. Thus, Multics tamper-protection\\nis “securable” as Saltzer stated, but discretionary access control makes its tamperprotectionbrittle.', '41a0e32e-4c40-47bb-ab96-fb7aa2853eec': 'If we assume that all the code segments in rings 0–3 are part of thetrusted computing base, then the TCB is large, but can be protected in the same manner asthe supervisor in ring 0.\\nThe integrity of the TCB depends on its system-deﬁned ring bracket policy.

See Chapter 7 to see why the use of discretionary access control is problematic.\\n6.Veriﬁable: What is basis for the correctness of the system’s trusted computing base?3.3. MUL TICS SECURITY 35\\nThe implementation of the Multics TCB is too large to be formally veriﬁed [ 279].The project’s\\ngoal was to minimize the Multics implementation as much as possible, such that most, if not\\nall, of the TCB can be veriﬁed using manual auditing. This goal was not achieved by thecompletion of the Multics project, and in fact this limitation motivated the subsequent workin security kernels (see Chapter 6). As we will see in the next section, this resulted in somesecurity problems in Multics.\\n7.Veriﬁable: Does the protection system enforce the system’s security goals?\\nVerifying that the system’s security goals are enforced correctly involves ensuring that the\\npolicy: (1) protects the secrecy and integrity of the system and user data by the protection state;\\n(2) assigns subjects and objects to the policy labels correctly by the labeling state; and (3) ensures\\nthat all protection domain transitions protect the secrecy and integrity of the system and user\\ndata based on the transition state deﬁned by the call bracket rules.', '1f9cb386-51fb-484a-966c-f66099eb90ac': 'This goal was not achieved by thecompletion of the Multics project, and in fact this limitation motivated the subsequent workin security kernels (see Chapter 6).

The MLS secrecy policy is a manda-tory policy of information ﬂow secrecy goals, so the secrecy goals are enforced by the Multicssystem given a trusted TCB.\\nSecond, verifying the correct labeling of segments and processes is challenging since much\\nof this labeling is speciﬁed manually. The Multics policy does not explicitly state how newprocesses and segments are labeled, although we would expect that the norm is to inherit thelabels of the creating process.\\nThird, the transition state permits low integrity code in a less-privileged ring to transfer control\\nto high integrity code in a more-privileged ring through either gates or return gates based onthe call bracket rules. As discussed above, the security of these transitions depends on thecorrectness of the gates, but most systems do not even have this level of enforcement.\\nThis informal analysis shows that Multics security is largely very good, but risks remain.\\nIn this analysis, we describe powerful mediation, expressive tamperprooﬁng, and veriﬁable secrecycontrols and system integrity controls.

In addition to the issues above,\\nSaltzer mentions the need for secure communication between systems, control of physical accessto machines, the weakness of user-speciﬁed passwords, the complexity of gate protections for thesupervisor, the possibility of leaking secrets via reuse of uncleared memory or storage, excessiveprivileges for administrators, and others. These issues and challenges are not unique to Multics—aswe will see, every secure operating system design will ﬁght with these challenges. For a ﬁrst attempt\\nat building a secure operating system, the Multics project did an admirable job of identifying issues36 CHAPTER 3.

This was asigniﬁcant problem for Multics, especially given the limited computing power of that time. Thesmall number of deployed Multics systems probably also prevented the usability model of Multicsfrom spreading widely enough to become an accepted norm. As the UNIX community grew tonumbers that dwarfed the number of Multics administrators, the computing community came toaccept the open, but insecure, approach. Finally, operating systems are complex software components,so they undergo a fair amount of evolution. This was particularly true in the case of Multics, but anysystem maintenance must still preserve the security guarantees offered by the system. As we will seein the next section, this was not always the case.\\n3.4 MUL TICS VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS\\nIn 1974, a couple of Air Force researchers, Paul Karger and Roger Schell, performed a vulnerability\\nanalysis on the Multics system [ 159].

The details of the vulnerability require a deeper knowledge of Multics addressing thanwe provide, but the basic problem is that the Honeywell 645 hardware\\n6did not check the SDW\\naccess if the segment was reached by a speciﬁc format of indirect addressing. Thus, access to thesegment containing the indirection was checked for access, but not the segment containing theactual address to be executed.

One of the\\nmore signiﬁcant vulnerabilities was an error caused by misuse of a supervisor mode of execution, calledmaster mode . Master mode is an execution state that permits any privileged processor instructions\\nto be executed in the current ring. The original Multics design required master mode code to berestricted to ring 0 only [322]. However, this design choice resulted in all faults (i.e., divide-by-zero,page faults, etc.) incurring a ring transition from the user ring to ring 0 where the fault handlerwas located and then back to the user ring. A proposal to reduce the overhead on the system wasto enable execution of some fault handling (e.g., divide-by-zero and access violations) in the userring. These faults are reported to user programs anyway by a signaller module, so the proposal was\\nto run the signaller in user rings. But, the signaller uses some privileged instructions, so it must runin master mode.\\nPermitting the signaller to run in master mode in a user ring was deemed secure because of the\\nrestricted manner in which the signaller must be invoked, but this code was not designed to protectitself from malicious calls. The problem is that the signaller’s code expects a register to be loadedwith a reference to a section of the signaller’s code when it is called.', '71e2858e-7572-44ae-9465-dbb5422d638d': 'incurring a ring transition from the user ring to ring 0 where the fault handlerwas located and then back to the user ring.

The problem is that the signaller’s code expects a register to be loadedwith a reference to a section of the signaller’s code when it is called. Unfortunately, the signaller doesnot check that the register value is legitimate, so when the code became addressable in user rings, itbecame possible for a malicious user program to set the register to an arbitrary location “permittinghim to transfer to an arbitrary location while the CPU was still in master mode [ 159].” Thus, a\\nsigniﬁcant vulnerability was created in the Multics system. The problem was that the signaller codehad been written with other design rules in mind. This is why it is important to: (1) have clear designrules and (2) have approaches and (automated) tools to verify that the implementation meets thedesign rules.

UNIX started as a small project to build an operating system to play a game on anavailable PDP-7 computer. However, UNIX grew over the next 10 to 15 years into a system withconsiderable mindshare, such that a variety of commercial UNIX efforts were launched. The lack ofcoherence in these efforts may have limited the market penetration of UNIX, but many vendors, evenMicrosoft, had their own versions. UNIX remains a signiﬁcant operating system today, embodiedin many systems, such as Linux, Sun Solaris, IBM AIX, the various BSD systems, etc.\\nRecall from Chapter 3 that Bell Labs was a member of the Multics consortium. However,\\nBell Labs dropped out of the Multics project in 1969, primarily due to delays in the project. Ken\\nThompson adapted some of the ideas of Multics when he initiated the construction of a system\\nthat was named as a pun on the Multics system, UNICS (UNIplexed Information and ComputingService).', 'e2922375-4292-4e8f-9c7f-e2543b1441d4': 'However, UNIX grew over the next 10 to 15 years into a system withconsiderable mindshare, such that a variety of commercial UNIX efforts were launched.

Eventually and mysteriously, the system was renamed UNIX, but the project had begun.\\nUNIX gained mindshare for a number of reasons. Ritchie rewrote UNIX in his new program-\\nming language C which enabled UNIX to be the ﬁrst portable operating system. This enabled thedevelopment of a UNIX community, since lots of people could run UNIX on a variety of differenthardware. Next, an application program interface was designed for UNIX which enabled program-mers to write application easily, without resorting to assembly language, and these applications ranacross the variety of UNIX-supported platforms. Finally, UNIX was truly simpliﬁed when comparedto Multics. While UNIX adopted many Multics principles, such as hierarchical ﬁle systems, virtualmemory, and encrypted passwords, UNIX was far simpler. UNIX aimed for a small base programcalled the kernel with a standard interface to simplify the development of applications.

The integrity and security of ring 0 are paramount, as any compromise at this level could potentially jeopardize the entire system. The implementation ensures that only trusted, verified code runs in ring 0, and strict controls are in place to prevent code in higher-numbered rings from interfering with or accessing the operations within ring 0.\n","Relevancy Score: 1.0 | Feedback: YES\n","Faithfulness Score: 1.0 | Feedback: YES\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Query 11 (Irrelevant): What is the capital of Mars?\n","Response: Mars does not have a capital because it is a planet and not a political entity with defined cities or capitals.\n","Relevancy Score: 0.0 | Feedback: NO\n","Faithfulness Score: 0.0 | Feedback: NO\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Query 12 (Irrelevant): How do I bake a chocolate cake?\n","Response: The provided context does not contain information on how to bake a chocolate cake.\n","Relevancy Score: 0.0 | Feedback: NO\n","Faithfulness Score: 1.0 | Feedback: YES\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Query 13 (Irrelevant): What's the weather like on Jupiter?\n","Response: The provided context does not contain information about the weather on Jupiter.\n","Relevancy Score: 0.0 | Feedback: NO\n","Faithfulness Score: 0.0 | Feedback: NO\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Query 14 (Irrelevant): Who won the 2025 Olympics?\n","Response: The provided text does not contain information about the winner of the 2025 Olympics.\n","Relevancy Score: 0.0 | Feedback: NO\n","Faithfulness Score: 0.0 | Feedback: NO\n","--------------------------------------------------\n","\n","Query 15 (Irrelevant): How do you cure hiccups in elephants?\n","Response: The provided context does not contain information related to curing hiccups in elephants or any veterinary practices.

                                            The challenges and setbacks faced during the development of the Multics project included delays in hardware delivery, which led to the project not being self-hosting until 1968. Additionally, there were concerns about project termination by ARPA in 1969, and Bell Labs dropping out of the project the same year. The Multics system itself turned out to be bigger, slower, and less reliable than expected. Despite these setbacks, significant operating systems and security features were developed that have influenced modern systems like UNIX. The project's ambitious goals, diverse partners, and the need to develop an entire ecosystem added to the complexity. However, the project's persistence and unique situation allowed it to pursue long-term goals, resulting in the development of a secure operating system.   \n","1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The primary purchasers of the Multics systems were government organizations, university systems, and large US corporations.

These factors collectively provided the project with a unique environment that allowed it to pursue ambitious, long-term goals such as building a secure operating system.   \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Processes in the Multics system are the executable contexts that run program code. They encompass all the code, data, and I/O devices that can be accessed by a process. On the other hand, segments in Multics store these components in an organized manner. Segments are structured into a hierarchy of directories that can contain directories or segments. A process's protection domain determines the segments it can access, with each segment having its own accessibility settings defining which subjects can access it and the operations they can perform. Segments can be addressed locally within a process's context or by name from secondary storage, similar to modern file systems. When a Multics process requests a segment not in its descriptor segment, it must name the segment hierarchically, starting from the root directory down to the specific segment name.   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Processes in the Multics system are the executable contexts that run program code, while segments store all code, data, and I/O devices that can be accessed by a process.

For example, if a Multics process needs to access the segment named /U2/War/NewYearsDay, it starts with the root directory, then proceeds to subsequent descendant directories (U2 and War), and finally specifies the name of the actual segment (NewYearsDay). This naming convention allows the process to identify the desired segment within the system's memory. If the process has the necessary permissions to access the segment and all the directories in the segment's path, a new Segment Descriptor Word (SDW) is created with the appropriate permissions and loaded into the process's descriptor segment.   \n","6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  When a Multics process requests a segment that is not already in its descriptor segment, it must name the segment hierarchically, similar to a file path.

It is important to note that the process must also have access permissions to all the directories in the segment's path in order to successfully access the segment.   \n","7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                When a user logs into a Multics system, the process begins with a component of the trusted computing base (TCB) verifying the user's password and creating a process for the user to perform their tasks. The user login is facilitated by the answering service, which is responsible for authenticating the user by retrieving the password segment from the file system. To authorize the loading and use of the password segment, the answering service requires the supervisor to load the password segment descriptor word into its descriptor segment. The supervisor, as the most trusted component in the Multics system, handles critical functionalities like authorization, segmentation, file systems, I/O, and scheduling. The answering service assigns the user to a process and must be trusted by the supervisor for authentication purposes.   \n","8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          When a user logs into a Multics system, the process begins with the answering service verifying the user's password and creating a process for the user to carry out their tasks.

This hierarchical layering of protection rings ensures that the supervisor's segments are protected from modification by processes running in higher rings. The supervisor's role in the user authentication process is to authorize access to the password segment and add a SDW for it to the answering service's descriptor segment. This ensures that the answering service can securely access the necessary information for user authentication without compromising the integrity of the system.   \n","9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The protection rings in the Multics system were implemented using a hierarchical structure with multiple rings. In the GE 645 Multics system, there were a total of six protection rings. Ring 0 was the most privileged ring in this hierarchy, where critical system functions and the supervisor resided. Ring 0 was responsible for protecting the reference monitor and ensuring that untrusted processes could not compromise the system. The significance of ring 0 was to provide a secure environment for essential system operations and to prevent unauthorized access or modifications to the core components of the system.   \n","10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The capital of Mars is not applicable as Mars is a planet in our solar system and does not have a capital city like countries on Earth.   \n","11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Baking a chocolate cake typically involves gathering ingredients such as flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, eggs, milk, and butter. You would then mix the dry ingredients together, beat the wet ingredients separately, and combine them gradually. Pour the batter into a greased cake pan and bake in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool before frosting it with chocolate frosting or ganache.

the project not being self-hosting until 1968. Additionally, there were concerns about project termination by ARPA in 1969, and Bell Labs dropped out of the project the same year. The Multics system itself turned out to be bigger, slower, and less reliable than expected. Despite these setbacks, the project did contribute significantly to the development of operating systems and security features that are still used in modern systems today. The challenges and setbacks influenced the eventual outcome of the project by shaping its trajectory, leading to the termination of Multics development in 1985, although Multics systems remained in use until 2000. The project's difficulties highlighted the importance of adaptability and the need to balance ambitious goals with practical considerations in large-scale system development.   \n","16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The primary purchasers of the Multics systems were government organizations, university systems, and large US corporations.

They encompass all the code, data, and I/O devices that can be accessed by a process. On the other hand, segments in Multics store these elements in an organized manner. Segments are structured into a hierarchy of directories that can contain directories or other segments. Each process in Multics has a protection domain that defines the segments it can access. This protection domain consists of the segments that could be loaded into its descriptor segment and the operations that the process can perform on those segments. Segments in Multics have different levels of accessibility, determining which subjects can access the segment and the operations they are allowed to perform. Segments can be addressed locally within a process's context or by name from secondary storage, similar to modern file systems. When a Multics process requests a segment not in its descriptor segment, it must name the segment hierarchically, starting from the root directory and moving down to the specific segment name.   \n","19                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Processes in the Multics system are the executable contexts that run program code, while segments store all code, data, and I/O devices that can be accessed by a process.

Each segment is associated with accessibility, specifying which subjects can access the segment and the operations they are allowed to perform on it.   \n","20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             A Multics process requests a segment that is not already in its descriptor segment by naming the segment using a hierarchical path similar to a file system. For example, if a Multics process wants to access the segment named /U2/War/NewYearsDay, it starts with the root directory, then moves on to subsequent descendant directories (U2 and War), and finally specifies the name of the actual segment (NewYearsDay). This naming convention allows the process to locate and request the desired segment that is not directly accessible through its descriptor segment.   \n","21                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      When a Multics process requests a segment that is not already in its descriptor segment, it must name the segment hierarchically, similar to a file path. The system processes the segment name starting from the root directory, moving through subsequent descendant directories, and ending with the actual segment name. If the process has the necessary permissions to access the requested segment, a new segment descriptor word (SDW) is created with the required permissions and loaded into the process's descriptor segment. It is important to note that in addition to having permissions to access the segment, the process must also have access permissions for all the directories in the segment's path in order to successfully access the segment.   \n","22                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   When a user logs into a Multics system, the process involves the verification of the user's password by a component of the trusted computing base (TCB) and the creation of a process for the user to perform their tasks.

The supervisor ensures that the loading of the SDW for the password segment into the answering service's descriptor segment is authorized. It is isolated from other processes by protection rings, with the most privileged code running in ring 0.\\n\\nOverall, the supervisor authorizes access to the password segment, adds the SDW for it to the answering service's descriptor segment, and ensures that the answering service cannot modify its own descriptor segment. This way, the supervisor contributes to the secure authentication of users logging into the Multics system.   \n","24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Multics system implemented protection rings to control access levels and privileges within the system. In the GE 645 Multics system, there were multiple rings, with ring 0 being the most privileged and ring 4 being the least privileged. Ring 0 was significant as it housed the supervisor code and critical system services, providing the highest level of control and access within the system. The implementation of protection rings in Multics allowed for a structured approach to security and access control, ensuring that different levels of code and processes had appropriate permissions and restrictions based on their assigned ring level.   \n","25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The capital of Mars is not applicable as Mars is a planet in our solar system and does not have a capital like countries on Earth.   \n","26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Baking a chocolate cake typically involves gathering ingredients such as flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, salt, eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract. You would then mix the dry ingredients together, beat the wet ingredients separately, and combine them gradually. Pour the batter into a greased cake pan and bake in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool before frosting it with chocolate frosting or ganache.

Additionally, the supervisor performs protection domain transitions by changing the process's ring as described. Accessing a code segment has three allowed cases, two of which result in a ring transition. Invoking code in a ring below the access bracket results in a ring transition to a more privileged ring. Such transitions require entry through a special gate segment that verifies the number of arguments expected, the data type on each argument, and access requirements for each argument. The gate segment, also known as a gatekeeper, aims to protect the invoked code from potentially malicious input from lower-privileged code.   \n","30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The Multics project faced several challenges and setbacks during its development. One of the initial hurdles was the delay in the delivery of the GE 645 hardware, which pushed back the project's timeline. The project was initially expected to be completed in two and a half years, but it wasn't self-hosting until 1968. In 1969, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) considered terminating the project due to these delays and other issues. That same year, Bell Labs, one of the key contributors to the project, decided to withdraw their involvement.\\n\\nThe Multics system itself also did not meet initial expectations. It turned out to be larger, slower, and less reliable than anticipated. Despite these setbacks, the project did lead to the development of significant operating systems and security features that are still used in modern systems. For example, the UNIX system was developed by some of the Bell Labs researchers who had previously worked on the Multics project.\\n\\nThe project eventually resulted in a commercial product in 1973, a decade after the project began. However, due to its high cost, only about 80 licenses were sold, primarily to government organizations, university systems, and large US corporations. The last running Multics system was used until 2000 by the Canadian Department of National Defense. Despite the challenges and setbacks, the Multics project was unique in its ambitious goals and the breadth of tasks it undertook, which included hardware development, operating systems, and security features.   \n","31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The primary purchasers of the Multics systems were government organizations like the US Air Force, university systems such as the University of Southwest Louisiana and the French university system, and large US corporations including General Motors and Ford.

It was not just a substantial hardware project, but also a revolutionary operating systems project and a groundbreaking security project. This required a wide range of expertise and skills, hence the need for such a diverse team.   \n","32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The Multics project was unique in several ways. Firstly, it was characterized by a wide range of tasks. It was not only a substantial hardware project but also a revolutionary operating systems project and a groundbreaking security project. This wide scope of tasks would be challenging to manage even in today's context.\\n\\nSecondly, the project was marked by a diverse set of partners. The team included university and industry researchers, as well as a variety of government and industry engineers. This diversity brought together some of the greatest minds in computing, which is not an easy feat to achieve.\\n\\nLastly, the project had an unusually long duration under development. It persisted for nearly 10 years before any commercial product was released.

These segments are organized into a hierarchy of directories that may contain either directories or segments.\\n\\nA process's protection domain in the Multics system defines the segments that it can access. This protection domain consists of the segments that could be loaded into its descriptor segment and the operations that the process could then perform on those segments. Each segment is associated with its accessibility, which refers to the subjects whose processes can access the segment and the operations that they are allowed to perform.\\n\\nSegments can be addressed either locally within the process's context or by name from secondary storage, similar to modern file systems. Each process is associated with its own descriptor segment that contains a set of segment descriptor words (SDWs) that refer to all the segments that the process can directly access. If a process requests a segment that is not already in its descriptor segment, it must name the segment using what is analogous to a file path. Segments in Multics are named hierarchically, starting with the root directory, continuing with subsequent descendant directories, and finishing with the name of the actual segment.   \n","35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          When a Multics process needs to request a segment that is not already in its descriptor segment, it must name the segment in a way similar to a file path. Using the example of the segment named /U2/War/NewYearsDay, the process begins with the root directory, then continues with subsequent descendant directories, in this case, U2 and War, and ends with the name of the actual segment, which is NewYearsDay. If the process's subject has the necessary permissions to perform the requested operation on the segment, a new Segment Descriptor Word (SDW) is created with those permissions and loaded into the process's descriptor segment. It's important to note that the process must also have access to all the directories in the segment's path in order to access the segment.   \n","36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   When a Multics process requests a segment not already in its descriptor segment, it must identify the segment using a hierarchical naming system similar to a file path. An example of such a name could be /U2/War/NewYearsDay. This name is processed starting from the root directory, followed by subsequent descendant directories (U2 and War in this case), and ending with the actual segment name (NewYearsDay in this example). This method of segment access laid the groundwork for later hierarchical file systems like UNIX.\\n\\nPermissions play a crucial role in this process. If the process's subject has the necessary permissions to perform the requested operation on the segment, a new Segment Descriptor Word (SDW) is created with those permissions and loaded into the process's descriptor segment. However, it's important to note that the process must also have access to all the directories in the segment's path to access the segment.   \n","37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     When a user logs into a Multics system, the process begins with a component of the trusted computing base (TCB) verifying the user's password and building a process for the user to perform their tasks. This login process is implemented by a process known as the answering service. The answering service is responsible for authenticating the user. It does this by retrieving the password segment from the file system, which involves loading the password Segment Descriptor Word (SDW) into its descriptor segment. \\n\\nThe core Multics component, the supervisor, must authorize the loading and subsequent use of the password segment. If authorized, a SDW for the password segment is loaded into the answering service's descriptor segment. The supervisor is responsible for implementing the most trusted functionality in the Multics system, such as authorization, segmentation, file systems, I/O, scheduling, and more. \\n\\nThe answering service also plays a crucial role in assigning the user of a process. If the answering service were to act maliciously, the process could potentially gain unauthorized permissions by being assigned to the wrong user. Therefore, the answering service must be trusted by the supervisor for certain functions. \\n\\nThe TCB, which includes the supervisor and other trusted components, is responsible for ensuring the security and integrity of the system. Over time, the TCB for the Multics system evolved, reflecting the ongoing development of the Multics architecture.   \n","38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            When a user logs into a Multics system, the process begins with a component of the trusted computing base verifying the user's password and creating a process for the user to perform their tasks.

The supervisor is responsible for implementing the most trusted functionalities in the Multics system, such as authorization, segmentation, file systems, I/O, scheduling, and more. \\n\\nThe supervisor is isolated from other processes by protection rings, which form a hierarchical layering from the most privileged ring, where the most-privileged code in the supervisor runs, to the least privileged ring. This isolation protects the supervisor from other processes, as only its segments are assigned to the most privileged rings, and no process running in a higher ring can modify its segments. Therefore, processes can only cause a modification of the supervisor's state by invoking supervisor code that runs in the most privileged ring. \\n\\nIn summary, the supervisor plays a critical role in user authentication in a Multics system by authorizing the retrieval and use of the password segment, and by implementing key functionalities. It is protected from other processes by the use of protection rings.   \n","39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The concept of protection rings in the Multics system is a mechanism to limit the actions of code based on its assigned ring. The lower the ring number, the more privileged the code, with ring 0 being the most privileged. Ring 0 can limit the actions of code in ring 1, and so on. Decisions about what code belongs in which ring were an ongoing process throughout the Multics project. \\n\\nThe significance of ring 0 in this hierarchy is that it is the most privileged and can control the actions of all other rings. It is also where the Multics reference monitor is implemented, which is protected by a combination of the protection ring isolations and system-defined ring bracket policy. This policy prevents processes outside of ring 0 from reading or writing reference monitor code or state directly. \\n\\nHowever, the context does not provide specific information on the number of rings in the GE 645 Multics system or how they were implemented.   \n","40

The development of the Multics project faced several significant challenges and setbacks that influenced its eventual outcome. Initially, the project had ambitious goals to revolutionize operating systems, which set high expectations but also led to complexities in its execution. One of the first major setbacks was the delay in the delivery of the GE 645 hardware, which pushed back the project timeline significantly. Multics was not self-hosting until 1968, which was a delay from the planned schedule.\\n\\nFurther complications arose when ARPA considered terminating the project in 1969 due to these delays and other issues. That same year, Bell Labs withdrew from the project, removing a key partner and contributor to the development effort. These events underscored the difficulties in managing such a complex, multi-partner initiative.\\n\\nDespite these setbacks, the project did manage to produce a system that included several innovative features, particularly in operating systems and security. However, the system was also criticized for being bigger, slower, and less reliable than expected. This perception affected its commercial viability and adoption, as it was initially priced at $7 million, limiting its market primarily to large organizations like government bodies, universities, and major corporations.\\n\\nUltimately, while the Multics system did not meet all its initial expectations, the challenges it faced during development led to significant contributions to the field of computing. The project's experiences and outcomes helped pave the way for future systems, most notably UNIX, which was developed by researchers who had worked on Multics after leaving the project. Thus, despite its struggles and limited commercial success, Multics had a lasting impact on the development of operating systems and security features in computing.   \n","46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The primary purchasers of Multics systems were government organizations, university systems, and large US corporations, specifically mentioned are the US Air Force, the University of Southwest Louisiana, the French university system, General Motors, and Ford. \\n\\nThe Multics project team consisted of a diverse group of university and industry researchers in addition to government and industry engineers because the project was ambitious and complex, involving substantial hardware development, revolutionary operating system innovations, and groundbreaking security features. This diversity in the team brought together a wide range of expertise and perspectives necessary to tackle the project's broad scope and challenges.   \n","47  The Multics project was distinguished by several unique characteristics that collectively enabled it to pursue ambitious, long-term goals. These characteristics include its breadth of tasks, diversity of partners, and the extended duration under development.\\n\\nFirstly, the breadth of tasks involved in the Multics project was exceptionally wide-ranging. It was not only a hardware project but also involved the development of a revolutionary operating system and groundbreaking security features. This comprehensive scope required the creation and integration of various technological components, including compilers and system software, which are essential for programming to the hardware. The complexity and scale of these tasks were significant, as they aimed to build a secure and robust operating system from the ground up.\\n\\nSecondly, the diversity of partners in the Multics project was another key characteristic. The team included university researchers, industry researchers, and engineers from both government and industry sectors. This collaboration brought together a wide range of expertise and perspectives, which enriched the project and enhanced its innovative potential. The involvement of top computer minds from various fields contributed to the project's ability to tackle complex problems and develop pioneering solutions.\\n\\nLastly, the duration under development, which lasted nearly a decade before the release of any commercial product, was unusually long, especially by today's standards. This extended period allowed the project team to thoroughly research, test, and refine their technologies. It provided the necessary time to overcome technical challenges and achieve the high standards set for the project. The ability to work without the immediate pressures of market demands enabled the team to focus on quality and innovation rather than rushing to release a product.\\n\\nThese factors—the project's scope, the diversity of its team, and the lengthy development phase—collectively facilitated the pursuit of ambitious, long-term goals. They allowed for a depth of development that is rare in projects constrained by shorter timelines and narrower objectives. The legacy of the Multics project, including its influence on subsequent operating systems like UNIX, underscores the value of such an expansive and collaborative approach in technological innovation.   \n","48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The fundamental concepts of the Multics system architecture revolve around processes and segments. In this architecture, processes represent the executable contexts, meaning they are the entities within which program code is run. Essentially, a process in Multics is what executes the code and performs tasks.\\n\\nSegments, on the other hand, are the storage units where all the code, data, and I/O devices that a process may need access to are stored. These segments are organized into a hierarchical structure of directories, which can contain further directories or segments. This hierarchical organization is similar to modern file systems, where data is structured in directories and subdirectories.\\n\\nEach process in Multics operates within a defined protection domain, which determines the segments that the process can access. This protection domain includes the segments that can be loaded into the process's descriptor segment and the operations the process can perform on these segments. Accessibility of segments is controlled by defining which processes (subjects) can access which segments and what operations they are allowed to perform on them.\\n\\nSegments can be addressed in two main ways: locally within the process’s context or by name from secondary storage, similar to accessing files in a file system using a path. For segments that are already part of a process's context, they are directly addressable through a descriptor segment associated with the process. This descriptor segment contains segment descriptor words (SDWs) that reference all the segments directly accessible to the process.\\n\\nIn summary, in the Multics system, processes are the dynamic entities that execute code, while segments are the static structures that store all necessary resources, organized hierarchically and accessed based on defined security protocols within a process's protection domain.   \n","49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The fundamental concepts of the Multics system revolve around processes and segments.

This system allows for a structured and secure method of segment access, governed by the defined protection domain of each process.   \n","50                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          When a Multics process needs to access a segment that is not already in its descriptor segment, it follows a hierarchical naming system similar to a file path to specify the desired segment. For instance, if a process needs to access the segment named /U2/War/NewYearsDay, it starts by referencing the root directory. It then sequentially accesses the directories named in the path: first \"U2\", then \"War\", and finally the specific segment \"NewYearsDay\".\\n\\nAs the process traverses this path, it must have the necessary permissions to access each directory and the final segment. If the process has the appropriate permissions, a new Segment Descriptor Word (SDW) is created for the NewYearsDay segment. This SDW includes permissions specific to the operations the process can perform on this segment and is then loaded into the process’s descriptor segment. This allows the process to directly address the NewYearsDay segment in subsequent operations. \\n\\nThe entire procedure ensures that only authorized processes can access specific segments, maintaining the security and integrity of the system’s data.   \n","51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  In a Multics system, when a process requests access to a segment that is not already present in its descriptor segment, the process must specify the segment using a hierarchical naming convention similar to a file path. This hierarchical naming starts from a root directory and proceeds through any necessary descendant directories until reaching the specific segment desired. For example, a segment might be named /U2/War/NewYearsDay, where \"U2\" and \"War\" are directories, and \"NewYearsDay\" is the actual segment.\\n\\nOnce the segment name is specified, the system checks if the process has the necessary permissions to access the segment and all the directories leading to it. If the permissions are adequate, a new Segment Descriptor Word (SDW) is created with the appropriate permissions. This new SDW is then loaded into the process's descriptor segment, allowing the process to access the segment.\\n\\nPermissions play a crucial role in this process as they determine whether a process can access a specific segment. The system must ensure that the process has rights not only to the segment itself but also to all intermediate directories in the path to that segment. This hierarchical permission checking ensures that the system maintains security and access control as defined by the system's security policies and the configuration of the directories and segments.   \n","52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             When a user logs into a Multics system, the process begins with the trusted computing base (TCB) verifying the user's password and constructing a process for the user to perform their tasks. This verification and process creation are managed by a component known as the answering service. The answering service is responsible for authenticating the user, which involves retrieving the user's password segment from the file system. This is done by loading the password segment descriptor word (SDW) into its descriptor segment.\\n\\nThe use of the password segment, including its loading and subsequent operations, must be authorized by the core component of the Multics system, the supervisor. The supervisor, which implements the most trusted functionalities like authorization, segmentation, file systems, I/O, scheduling, and more, ensures that the answering service is permitted to access and utilize the password segment for authentication purposes.\\n\\nThus, the TCB, through the answering service and under the authorization of the supervisor, plays a crucial role in securely managing user logins by verifying user credentials and setting up the necessary user environment for system interaction.   \n","53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           When a user logs into a Multics system, the process begins with the user submitting their password to the answering service. This service is responsible for initiating the authentication process. The key steps involved in this process are as follows:\\n\\n1. **Password Verification**: The answering service retrieves the user's password from the password segment stored in the file system. This involves loading the Segment Descriptor Word (SDW) for the password segment into the answering service's descriptor segment.\\n\\n2. **Authorization by the Supervisor**: The supervisor, which operates in the privileged protection ring 0, plays a crucial role in this step. It authorizes the answering service to access the password segment. This authorization is necessary to ensure that only legitimate processes can access sensitive segments like the password segment.\\n\\n3. **Segment Loading**: Once authorized, the SDW for the password segment is added to the answering service’s descriptor segment. This allows the answering service to access the password data and verify it against the user's input.\\n\\nThe supervisor's role is central to the security and integrity of the system during the login process. It ensures that:\\n- Only authorized processes can access sensitive information.\\n- The integrity of the system is maintained by isolating its functionality in a high-privilege ring (ring 0).\\n- It controls access to critical system resources like segmentation, file systems, and scheduling.\\n\\nThis structured approach to user authentication, driven by the supervisor's oversight, helps protect the system from unauthorized access and potential security breaches.   \n","54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The concept of protection rings in the Multics system is a mechanism designed to enforce security by segregating system operations across different levels of privilege. These rings are hierarchical, with each ring designated a specific level of trust and operational capability. The lower the ring number, the higher the privilege level, allowing more sensitive operations to be performed.\\n\\nIn the GE 645 implementation of the Multics system, there were multiple rings, typically four, numbered from 0 to 3. Ring 0 held the highest level of privilege and contained critical system code, including the reference monitor, which enforced security policies and mediated access to system resources. This ring was crucial for system integrity and security, as it controlled access to the rest of the system.\\n\\nRings 1 through 3 contained progressively less privileged code. For example, system services that did not require the highest level of trust might be placed in ring 1 or 2, while user applications typically ran in ring 3 or higher. This structure was designed to minimize the potential damage from less trusted or less secure code by limiting its access to critical system functions.\\n\\nThe significance of ring 0 in this hierarchy is profound, as it serves as the core of the system's security and operational integrity. Code running in ring 0 has unrestricted access to the entire system, and thus it is heavily protected against unauthorized access and tampering. The integrity and security of ring 0 are paramount, as any compromise at this level could potentially jeopardize the entire system. The implementation ensures that only trusted, verified code runs in ring 0, and strict controls are in place to prevent code in higher-numbered rings from interfering with or accessing the operations within ring 0.   \n","55
