# 📚 RAG-PRISM: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Educational Tutoring with LlamaIndex + OpenAI

> **This is an ongoing academic and applied research project** focused on building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using [LlamaIndex](https://llamaindex.ai/) and OpenAI’s LLMs to support intelligent tutoring systems for domain-specific education (e.g. cybersecurity).

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a robust document question-answering system using RAG, where educational content (PDFs, structured docs) is first embedded and indexed using **LlamaIndex**, and then queried using **GPT-3.5/4** to produce grounded, high-quality answers.

It follows a proposed architecture called **RAG-PRISM**, developed as part of a capstone research paper.
